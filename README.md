- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alexey-Naumenko
- ðŸ‘€ I work for some space company, and am also involved in the development of the CoMaps project. At my day job, I'm an IT recruiter.  
In my spare time, I'm busy helping to develop a free offline maps app [https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps](https://www.comaps.app/) based on the OpenStreetMap project, 
as well as maintaining several non-profit project e.g. https://github.com/safetytracker  (free open source geo-locator via SMS)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://t.me/ooprizrakoo
- âš¡ Fun fact: There is also my old github account https://github.com/ooprizrakoo, the 2FA key for which was lost and tech support was unable to help recover .
