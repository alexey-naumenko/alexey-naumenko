- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alexey-Naumenko
- ðŸ‘€ I work at Postgres Professional and am also involved in the development of the Organic Maps project. At my day job, I'm an IT recruiter.  In my spare time, I'm busy helping to develop a free offline maps project based on the OpenStreetMap project, as well as maintaining several non-profit websites.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://t.me/ooprizrakoo
- âš¡ Fun fact: There is also my old github account https://github.com/ooprizrakoo, the 2FA key for which was lost and tech support was unable to help recover .
